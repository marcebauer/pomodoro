# Welcome to my Pomodoro
## A rather simple take on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique>famous time management technique.</a>

<p>This was a really fun little project I ironically conceived while procrastinating.</p>
<p>In case you are unfamiliar with the technique, it basically consists of four 25 minute periods of studying, each followed by a 5 minute break except the last one, which gets a 15 minute break. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>These days you would be hard pressed not to find a Pomodoro app somewhere on the Internet, but I wanted to raise the stakes, so to speak. So I placed a cute tomato that slowly dies when you get distracted or purposely stop the timer.</p>
<p>Basically, upon hitting the button to start you are tasked with hitting it again each time you reach another study session (a downbeat sound will let you know it's time), otherwise the tomato rots away in a minute and you have to start over.</p>
